# AttendanceManagementSystem
XYZ University wants to design an online attendance system for students and faculty. There are three users for the system 1. Admin, 2. Lecturer and 3. Students. The system can register the users like lecturer to handle daily attendance of students which are assign intakewise by admin. Also it is able to register the intakewise students to check their own attendance. Attendance will be marked with any one of the 4 options which are 1. PRESENT 2. ABSENT 3. ABSENT WITH REASON and 4. LATE 
 
All User can login using their login id and password to handle the system. The       functionality of the users are given below. 
 
Admin 1. If User (Lecturer / Student) donâ€™t have login id then Admin will register the Lecturer and Students.  2. Admin can view all the Lecturer / Students. 3. Admin can search specific Lecturer / Student record. 4. Admin can delete the record of Lecturer / students. 5. Admin can modify the detail of Lecturer / students. 6. Admin can update/modify the attendance of student by considering their request. That means admin can change / mark the ABSENT record of student to ABSENT WITH REASON. 
 
Lecturer 1. Lecturer can view the intakewise students which are assign to him/her. 2. Lecturer can mark the attendance of students by providing lecture date, start time, end time, module name and intake code. Lecturer only allow to mark PRESENT, ABSENT or LATE. 3. Lecturer can modify the attendance of student. 
 
Student 1. Students can view their attendance record by login with the system. 2. If student is absent because of some reason then he/she have to provide the specific reason to the admin so that the attendance record is going to be change from ABSENT to ABSENT WITH REASON.
